# Germany_Farm_Subsidies
Business Intelligence and Data warehousing using MySQL and Pentaho (ETL)

This project consists of designing a one-time historic load of the German Farm Subsidies data using 
an ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) tool.

At the end of this project the following ETL documents will be ready:
- Data Mapping document: A document that describes the default strategy for extracting data from 
data source, data mapping process, and data quality tracking and metadata approach. 
- ETL Scripts: The collection of ETL processes created with a data integration tool (i.e. PDI to be 
specific)
- Database backup: A backup file of the database and schema was created after the ETL process has 
been executed successfully
