# Germany_Farm_Subsidies
Business Intelligence and Data warehousing using MySQL and Pentaho (ETL) and Tableau

In the first project assignment, our group designs a data warehouse (data mart) based on a dataset 
of German Farm Subsidies disbursed by EU towards farmers across the Union. We analyze the data 
provided with a data quality check and design a data warehouse where we conclude that the best 
model follows a Snowflake schema. 

The second assignment is focused on Data Integration using Pentaho. It consists of designing a 
one-time historic load of the German Farm Subsidies data using an ETL (Extraction, 
Transformation and Loading) tool.

This project consists of designing a one-time historic load of the German Farm Subsidies data using 
an ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) tool.

At the end of this project the following ETL documents will be ready:
- Data Mapping document: A document that describes the default strategy for extracting data from 
data source, data mapping process, and data quality tracking and metadata approach. 
- ETL Scripts: The collection of ETL processes created with a data integration tool (i.e. PDI to be 
specific)
- Database backup: A backup file of the database and schema was created after the ETL process has 
been executed successfully

This third assignment is focused on generating value from the data warehouse after 
transformations. It consists of designing a dashboard and/or a story using Tableau.
